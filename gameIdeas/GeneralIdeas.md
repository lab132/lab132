- malus for drinking potions with head gear on
  - Inspired by Dark Souls where you have a limited amount of "Estus Flasks" you can consume. In Dark Souls the speed with which you consume an Estus Flask is constant.The idea is that the time it takes to consume a potion is tied to the kind of headgear the player character is wearing. A heavy helmet for example would slow down consumption time quite a bit while wearing a simple hat (a mages hat, for example) would only slightly increase consumption time, if at all.
